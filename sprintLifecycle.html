            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>This tutorial walks through using Trello during your Sprint Cycle.</p>
            
            <h3>What is a Sprint Cycle</h3>
            <p>A sprint cycle is an incremental two to four week period where a Scrum team works toward a potentially shippable product. The teams works through all the tasks required to meet the user story's acceptance criteria. When all tasks are completed it is reviewed by the team and tested before accepting as done.</p>

            <h4>Pulling Tasks</h4>
            <ol>
              <i><strong>Reminder:</strong> Pulling a task means each team member chooses a task from the Sprint Backlog to complete.</i>
              <li>Review Current Sprint Backlog and the tasks for each user story</li>
              <li>Choose one to two tasks to start working on from the Sprint's user stories</li>

              <p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Do not put a checkmark next to the task. This is done when the task is complete. We are just looking at what we want to work on.</i></p>
              <li>Once you have chosen a task(s), make sure the user story is selected</li>
              <li>On the right-hand side under the sub memnu Add, select Members</li>

            </ol>
            <h4>Documenting what you are working on and moving a user story to In Progress</h4>
            <ol>
              <i><strong>Note:</strong> Since tasks can be pulled from any team member, it is helpful to document what task you are working on.</i>

              <p><i><strong>Note:</strong> The review process is made up of testing implemented code, reviewing definition of done, and make sure acceptance criteria met for the user story.</i></p>
              <li>Go through your review process to confirm Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done met</li>
              <li>Open user story once review completed</li>
              <li>Put a checkmark next to the criteria met.</li>
