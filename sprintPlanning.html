            <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
            <h4>Adding Technical Tasks</h4>
            <ol>
              <i><strong>Reminder:</strong> Technical Tasks are specific code, design, test, etc, that fulfill an acceptance criteria.</i>
              <li>First move the user stories agreed upon for sprint to Current Sprint Backlog</li>
              <img src="images/plan_image3.png" alt="Image showing how to moved user stories">
              <li>Click a user story to expand the user story card</li>
              <li>Under Add on the right-hand side click Checklist</li>
              <img src="images/plan_image4.png" alt="Image shows where checklist button is on the right-hand side of user story card">

            </ol>
            <h4>Adding Story Points</h4>
            <ol>
              <i><strong>Reminder:</strong> Story points is a measurement used to determine the amount of effort needed to implement a story and task. The measurement can be based on anything you can think of from time to complexity.</i>
              <li>Next need to play some planning-poker to determine the points for each task</li>
              <p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Planning-poker is a tool where a team reviews a user story and each member puts down a numeric value for the story. If the values are all different, then the team discusses why and replays the game until a concensous is made.<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker" target="_blank"> https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker</a></i>
              <li>Add up your points per task and add the total point value to your stories by editing each user story</li>
              <img src="images/plan_image7.png" alt="Image shows editing the user story title and adding pts to it">
              <li>You should now have points assigned to each user story for your sprint and the additional tasks needed to complete the Sprint.</li>
